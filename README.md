# PARKINSONS-DISEASE-DETECTION
This project investigates the application of data science
techniques in the early detection of Parkinson's disease (PD). By
leveraging a wide range of data sources, including medical
imaging, genetic information, and clinical assessments, we
develop a robust predictive model to differentiate individuals
with PD from healthy controls. Various machine learning
algorithms, such as support vector machines, random forests, and
neural networks, are employed to analyze and extract meaningful
patterns from the data. The performance of these models is
assessed using standard evaluation metrics, including accuracy,
precision, recall, and area under the curve (AUC).

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the significant potential
of data science in advancing early detection and personalized
treatment strategies for Parkinson's disease. The integration of
diverse data sources and machine learning algorithms provides a
comprehensive and efficient approach to identify individuals at
risk and facilitate timely interventions. This research contributes
to the growing body of knowledge in the field and holds promise
for improving patient outcomes in Parkinson's disease.
